        <p>My name is Connor Best and I am a Marketing major at the University of Central Florida. In addition to studying Marketing,
        I am also attending a web development bootcamp offered through UCF where I am training to become a Full Stack Developer. 
        I am currently working for a sports streaming company that has done what I thought impossible, destroyed my interest in sports.
        When I'm not in work or school I enjoy watching movies, going to the gym, gaming when time permits and spending time with my girlfriend
        and family.
